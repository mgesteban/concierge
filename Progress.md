# Progress Log — BoardBreeze Concierge

Running log of daily progress for the Apr 21–27 2026 hackathon.
Source material for the README's v0→v5 "Keep Thinking" narrative and the
demo video voiceover. Generated (mostly) by the `/status` skill at end of day.

**Submission deadline:** Sun 2026-04-26, 8:00 PM EST.

## 2026-04-22 (Wed) — Scaffold day

**Shipped today**
- Public repo initialized at https://github.com/mgesteban/concierge (MIT license).
- FastAPI skeleton: `app/main.py`, `/health`, Twilio SMS + Voice webhook routers.
- Agent modules scaffolded: Concierge supervisor, Governance Expert (wrapping the reference loop), and stubs for Sales Closer, Product Expert, Tech Support, Escalation.
- Governance tools integrated as `app/tools/governance_tools/` — 4 Anthropic tools (`search_governance_kb`, `check_jurisdiction_rules`, `generate_compliant_template`, `hand_off_to_sales`) with Supabase pgvector backing, Voyage 1024-dim embeddings, offline tests.
- `verify_citation` tool stubbed at `app/tools/verify_citation.py` — real implementation lands Thursday.
- `.claude/skills/` seeded with `/interview`, `/governance-verify`, `/status` per Tark's power-move playbook (§16).
- README written against the four judging criteria: Impact, Demo, Opus 4.7 Use, Depth & Execution.

**What evolved (Keep Thinking)**
- Entered Wednesday assuming we'd scaffold the whole multi-agent architecture from scratch. Discovered the governance_tools package Grace had built earlier in the week was already production-grade (schemas, RAG, tests, reference agent loop) — folded it in as `app/tools/governance_tools/` instead of rewriting. Saved ~6 hours.
- Decided to keep the reference agent loop (`_governance_reference_loop.py`) alongside the production wrapper (`governance_expert.py`) so the evolution from "naive one-shot" to "verified multi-turn" is legible in the repo rather than buried in git history.

**Cut from today's plan**
- Intent classification in the Concierge supervisor — Wednesday uses keyword routing; real classifier lands Thursday after the Michael Cohen Managed Agents session.
- Supabase `conversation_state` write-through — schema is in place, but webhook handlers log to memory for now. Real persistence Thursday.

**Tomorrow's top 3 (Thu Apr 23)**
1. Attend Michael Cohen's Managed Agents session; convert orchestration to the pattern he recommends.
2. Implement `verify_citation` for real: KB lookup → Claude-based claim-support classifier → `{verified, actual_text, suggested_rewrite}`. Wire into Governance Expert's tool list.
3. Wire Twilio Voice end-to-end: ngrok → FastAPI → Concierge → Polly `<Say>` for day-one latency. (Deepgram/ElevenLabs streaming is a Friday upgrade.)

**Open questions / risks**
- The `NEVER`/`ALWAYS` language in the original Governance Expert system prompt contradicts Tark's §8.6 guidance for 4.7. Need to rewrite conditionally before Thursday's live tests — otherwise the agent will over-refuse benign explanatory questions.

**Evening addendum (post-push)**
- Pushed `51eb246` to `origin/main` after rebasing on top of GitHub's stub README commit. Repo is public, MIT licensed: https://github.com/mgesteban/concierge
- Resolved the three end-of-day unknowns:
  - ✅ Subscriber outreach — Grace has 3 BoardBreeze subscribers she can line up personally tomorrow; no cold email needed.
  - ✅ Twilio — account SID, auth token, and phone number already in hand.
  - ✅ Anthropic credits — $500 received.
- `.env` populated locally with Anthropic API key, Twilio (SID + auth + phone), ElevenLabs (API key + voice ID), and Grace's personal phone number for escalations. Supabase, Voyage, and Deepgram keys deferred until Thursday when those subsystems come online.
- Ready state for Thursday: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` should boot tomorrow with zero additional setup.

## 2026-04-23 (Thu) — Managed Agents pivot + first working voice loop

**The headline**

Grace asked her question live on Michael Cohen's Managed Agents session
this morning — the exact pattern we'd planned to build (distributed
6-agent topology with supervisor handoffs). His answer, verbatim:

> "I would probably just hold off until we get first-class support for
> multi-agents."

He confirmed it's shipping "very soon" but not production-ready today.
His recommendation matched Tark's from Tuesday: **one agent + many
skills/tools**, not N sub-agents. So we pivoted the whole architecture
in one pass. Details in `notes/cohen-managed-agents.md`.

**Shipped today**

- Morning infra: Python 3.11 venv via `uv`, Supabase project
  (`governance-concierge`) provisioned and schema-applied, Voyage
  account live, connectivity smoke-tested end-to-end. Caught and fixed
  a dimension mismatch (`voyage-3-lite` is 512-dim only, the tools
  package assumed 1024) before it could cause a runtime failure.
- `app/managed_agents/` — full CMA integration. `agent_spec.py` holds
  the consolidated Concierge system prompt (five specialist modes as
  described in §5 of the playbook, expressed as conditional-language
  guidance per CLAUDE.md rule #1). `client.py` is the single
  `handle_message(phone, text, channel) -> str` entry point both Twilio
  channels use — it idempotently ensures the agent + environment exist,
  finds-or-creates a CMA session keyed on caller phone via Supabase,
  sends `user.message`, streams events, dispatches custom tools inline,
  and returns assembled reply text. `custom_tools.py` implements
  `search_governance_kb`, `verify_citation` (stub), and
  `escalate_to_grace` (stub).
- CMA provisioning executed for real: agent `boardbreeze-concierge`
  (id `agent_011CaMckX2etSZait4iM4kfi`) and environment
  `boardbreeze-concierge-env` (id `env_01LFKsSa8ntB3j3MqeCuGUS4`) are
  live in Grace's Anthropic account.
- **First working reply from the Concierge**, via smoke test:
  > "Yes, this is the BoardBreeze concierge — how can I help you
  > today?"
- **First working tool dispatch**, also smoke-tested. Asked "how far
  ahead do I have to post the Brown Act agenda" — the agent adopted
  Governance Expert mode unprompted, called `search_governance_kb`
  with `jurisdiction: "CA"`, got an empty result (KB not seeded yet),
  and correctly fell back to a general 72-hour explanation plus a
  callback offer — exactly what the system prompt instructs on empty
  KB hits. The anti-hallucination guardrail (CLAUDE.md rule #2) works
  on day one of the new architecture.
- `app/channels/sms.py` + `voice.py`: rewired to call `handle_message`
  via `run_in_threadpool`. TwiML shape unchanged, so Twilio's console
  config doesn't need to change. Old supervisor scaffolding deleted.
- `app/db/migrations/001_phone_sessions.sql` — small table that makes
  "Jane texts Monday, texts again Thursday, agent remembers" free: we
  reuse the same CMA session across calls for the same E.164 number,
  and CMA sessions idle for weeks at no cost (Cohen confirmed live).

**What evolved (Keep Thinking)**

- Entered Thursday about to build a hand-rolled 6-agent supervisor loop
  in Python with explicit handoff payloads between modules. Cohen's
  session flipped the whole plan before any code was written. Net
  outcome: less code (five specialist `.py` files deleted), better
  prize positioning (we now use every CMA primitive idiomatically —
  agents, environments, sessions, custom tools, events), and a clean
  upgrade path when first-class multi-agent ships.
- The system prompt doubled as routing layer: instead of a keyword
  classifier in Python dispatching to specialist modules, the single
  consolidated prompt describes each specialist mode and lets Claude
  4.7 pick. The first governance question we threw at it routed
  correctly without any tuning.
- Realized we don't need the CMA sandbox container at all for this
  product — the Concierge is a chat concierge, not a coding agent.
  Custom tools (which run in our FastAPI backend, not in the sandbox)
  are the right shape for `verify_citation`, `search_governance_kb`,
  and `escalate_to_grace`. Keeps our KB and SMS credentials out of
  Claude's reach — good for demo narrative too.

**Cut from today's plan**

- Deepgram signup + streaming STT — still Friday, per original plan.
  Day-one voice uses Twilio `<Gather input="speech">` + Polly `<Say>`.
  Latency is ~3–5s/turn, fine for the Thursday milestone.
- Real `verify_citation` classifier — tool is registered and the stub
  is safe (returns `verified=false` with a conservative rewrite). Real
  classifier lands later today or Fri morning.
- KB seed from the Brown Act PDF — pending (task #7). Was going to do
  it this afternoon while Grace runs the migration; writing this
  entry first.

**Tomorrow's top 3 (Fri Apr 24)**

1. Real `verify_citation`: section-exact KB lookup → Claude-based
   claim-support classifier → `{verified, actual_text, suggested_rewrite}`.
   Golden-Q&A suite of 10 pairs, tune threshold until false-pass = 0.
2. Real `escalate_to_grace`: Twilio SMS to Grace + email via Gmail
   MCP, with caller transcript link.
3. Deepgram + ElevenLabs streaming upgrade to the voice channel. Same
   `handle_message` under the hood.
4. First real-subscriber user test — Grace has 3 BoardBreeze
   subscribers lined up.

**Open questions / risks**

- Memory store: Cohen teased it launching "in the next couple of hours"
  at ~11am PT. Haven't wired it yet. If it ships before Sun we get
  true cross-session memory for free — should check the Anthropic
  Twitter and docs tonight.
- Session reuse + RLS: the new `phone_sessions` table uses Supabase
  RLS like everything else. Our service-role key bypasses RLS so
  functionally fine, but if we ever add a public dashboard that reads
  this table, we need policies.
- TwiML `<Say>` with long Claude replies: if the agent produces a
  multi-paragraph answer, Polly will read the whole thing before
  listening again. Need to either cap reply length in the system
  prompt (already hinted with "two to four sentences") or chunk the
  `<Say>` blocks with intermediate `<Gather>` for barge-in. Revisit
  after first live call.
